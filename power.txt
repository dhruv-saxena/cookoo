Sleep current - 2 uA
Cap push osc. read current - 208 uA
LPM0 (active mode) - 443 uA
Continuous ADC with analog in floating (temp. sensor without reference Vg) - 560 uA
Continouous ADC to read battery (internal 1.5v reference used) - 1.2 mA


Average current with temp. ADC sampled once in 16 ms - 7.8 uA
Average current with battery ADC sampled once in 16 ms - 12.5 uA

Average current with whole program at 68 mS - 24 uA

Assuming a 20 mA buzzer runs at 70% duty cycle for 30 seconds a day, avg. buzzer current - 5 uA

Assuming that LEDs worth 10 mA operate for 20 seconds a day. LED current - 2.3 uA

Total avg. current = 31.3 uA. A CR2032 battery will last 266 days.
